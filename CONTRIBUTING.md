# Fork a Repo 

A *fork* is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

##### Propose changes to someone else's project

A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

- Fork the repository.
- Make the fix.
- Submit a *pull request* to the project owner.

If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!

# Create branches and push changes to the master repo

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

Change working branch :

```
$ git checkout [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

Push the branch on github :

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch. Add -u parameter to set upstream.

You can see all branches created by using :

```
$ git branch
```

Which will show :

```
* approval_messages
  master
  master_clean
```

Add a new remote for your branch :

```
$ git remote add [name_of_your_remote] 
```

Push changes from your commit into your branch :

```
$ git push [name_of_your_new_remote] [name_of_your_branch]
```

Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :

```
$ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]
```

Then you need to apply to merge changes, if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :

```
$ git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop
```

Delete a branch on your local filesystem :

```
$ git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :

```
$ git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

Delete the branch on github :

```
$ git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]
```
